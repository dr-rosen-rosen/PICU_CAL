# PICU_CAL Data Processing and Analysis
Code for the Collective Allostatic Load Project. 

This includes data processing for the following:
1. Survey (currently in Salar's repo; we'll merge at some point)
2. E4
3. RTLS
4. Sociometric (and openbadge)

## Notes on set up:
Most of the E4 and RTLS scripts are in python; so you need to set up a local venv called 'python3'; I'll post a requirements document for packages soon and we can keep that up to date. The venv is in the gitignore, so I think the requiremetns doc is the best way to manage that.
